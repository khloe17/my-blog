# Question

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

## Explanation

Example1:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

Example 2:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2

# Idea

In a BST, the left subtree contains values less than the root, and the right subtree contains values greater than the root. This property helps us efficiently determine the LCA:

1. If both `p` and `q` are smaller than the current node: The LCA must be in the left subtree.
2. If both `p` and `q` are larger than the current node: The LCA must be in the right subtree.
3. If one of `p` or `q` is on each side of the current node (or one is the current node itself): The current node is the LCA.

# Code

```python
# iterative implementation:

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        current = root

        while current:
            if p.val < current.val and q.val < current.val:
                current = current.left
            elif p.val > current.val and q.val > current.val:
                current = current.right
            else:
                return current

```

```python
# recursive implementation:

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if not root:
            return None

        if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        elif p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        else:
            return root

```
